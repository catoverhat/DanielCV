        I designed and built a rock-paper-scissors game using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript to practice my web design skills. The game features a simple,
        clean interface that is easy to navigate and understand. When the game
        is loaded, the user is presented with three options: rock, paper, or
        scissors. The user can select their choice by clicking on the
        corresponding button, which triggers the game logic. The computer's
        choice is generated randomly, and the winner is determined based on the
        standard rock-paper-scissors rules. The game keeps track of the user's
        score and displays it at the top of the screen. It also displays a
        message to let the user know whether they won, lost, or tied the round.
        To make the game more visually appealing, I used CSS to style the
        buttons and add hover effects. I also added an animated background to
        create a more engaging user experience. Overall, the rock-paper-scissors
        game demonstrates my ability to design and build a functional web
        application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also showcases my
        attention to detail and creativity in designing an attractive user
        interface.
